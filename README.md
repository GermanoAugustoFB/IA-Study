IA-STUDY

This repository contains projects and examples related to the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

📌 Purpose

The IA-STUDY repository was created to learn and practice the basics of AI and ML through hands-on examples.
Each folder focuses on a specific topic, with code implementations and documentation.

📂 Repository Structure

LinearRegression/

Example.py: A simple linear regression example using dummy data.

DecisionTreeClassification/ (in progress)

Example of classification using Decision Trees.

(more examples will be added as the learning process continues)

📊 Implemented Examples
🔹 Linear Regression (LinearRegression/Example.py)

This example demonstrates how to apply linear regression on a dummy dataset, predicting scores based on study hours.

Libraries used:

numpy → numerical operations

pandas → data handling (basic usage in this example)

matplotlib → visualization

scikit-learn → linear regression model

Steps:

Create dummy data (study hours x scores).

Train a linear regression model.

Plot real data points and the fitted regression line.

Display the coefficient (slope) and intercept.

▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install the required dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn


Navigate to the desired example folder.

Run the script, for example:

python Example.py

📝 Notes

The examples use dummy datasets for simplicity.

In real-world scenarios, actual datasets should be used.

Ensure all required libraries are properly installed to avoid import errors.
