IA-STUDY
This repository contains projects and examples related to artificial intelligence and machine learning studies.
Overview
The IA-STUDY repository is designed to explore various AI and ML concepts through practical examples. It includes different folders for specific topics, with code implementations and documentation.
Repository Structure

LinearRegression/
Example.py: A Python script demonstrating linear regression using dummy data.



Linear Regression Example
The LinearRegression folder contains an Example.py script that implements a simple linear regression model. This example uses dummy data to predict scores based on study hours.
Features

Uses numpy for numerical operations.
Uses pandas for data handling (though not extensively in this example).
Uses matplotlib for data visualization.
Uses scikit-learn for the linear regression model.

Code Description

Data: Dummy datasets for study hours (X) and corresponding scores (Y).
Model: A linear regression model is trained to fit the data.
Visualization: Plots the real data points and the fitted regression line.
Output: Displays the slope (coefficient) and intercept of the regression line.

How to Run

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install the required libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learnYou can install them using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn


Navigate to the LinearRegression folder.
Run the script:python Example.py



Sample Output

The script will display a plot showing the real data points and the fitted line.
Console output will include the coefficient (slope) and intercept values.

Notes

The example uses dummy data for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you would use actual datasets.
Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed to avoid import errors.
